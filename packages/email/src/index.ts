/**
 * @louez/email
 *
 * Email templates and sending logic.
 *
 * NOTE: Email implementation remains in apps/web/lib/email/ for now
 * due to dependencies on database and i18n messages.
 *
 * This package can be fully extracted in a future iteration when:
 * - Email templates can receive i18n messages as props
 * - Database logging is handled differently
 *
 * For now, import email functionality directly from the app:
 * import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/email'
